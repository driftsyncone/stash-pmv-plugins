# Stash plugins: Stash UI, PMV Generator, Media Storm, RedTok

> **This is a fork** of [anonym88312/stash-pmv-plugins](https://github.com/anonym88312/stash-pmv-plugins)
> that adds an **Autoblow VacuGlide** output to the PMV Generator (branch `vacuglide`,
> PMV Generator `2.32.1-vg.9`). Everything else is upstream, unchanged.
>
> - **Play on: The Handy / VacuGlide / Both**: the show's funscript is uploaded to the
>   VacuGlide as an Autoblow sync script and follows the show's clock. Defaults suited
>   to the VacuGlide (Sharp, Full strokes, top speed 600 /s).
> - The device token comes from the [VacuGlide Sync](https://github.com/driftsyncone/stash-plugins#vacuglide-sync)
>   plugin's settings, so set that up first.
> - [Beat Bar](https://github.com/driftsyncone/stash-plugins#beat-bar) themes can be
>   drawn over the show, on screen or in the recording.
> - A **Stash songs** tab (sound files in the library's "PMV Generator/Songs" folder), a song list that
>   mixes Stash songs and video rips, and an "Only music videos" filter.
>
> Install by copying `plugins/pmvGenerator` from this branch into your Stash plugins
> folder in place of the upstream one. Updating PMV Generator from its package source
> replaces it with upstream again. Unofficial; not affiliated with Autoblow. MIT, like upstream.

Four plugins for [Stash](https://github.com/stashapp/stash).

| Plugin | What it is |
|---|---|
| [**Stash UI**](plugins/stashui/README.md) | A complete new interface for Stash: browsing, player, image viewer, folders, tags, performers, statistics, duplicates, queue, tasks, plugins and all settings – in its own look with color themes and liquid glass. Classic Stash stays available in the same look. In English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, French, Spanish, German, Polish and Russian. |
| [**PMV Generator**](plugins/pmvGenerator/README.md) | Pick a song – or take the music from any video in your library – and on every beat it cuts to a clip from your library, with split-screen layouts, effects, speed ramps and clip audio. Live in the browser, optionally recorded and saved back to Stash. Plays several songs in a row, follows the music you play in **Plex**, or listens live to **Spotify** (or any app on your PC) as a visualizer. Can also rebuild an existing PMV with your own clips, and mix in clips from RedGifs. |
| [**Media Storm**](plugins/mediaStorm/README.md) | Random images and videos from your library appear in waves in their own tab – eight layouts, effects, moods, folder and tag filters, waves on the beat of a song. |
| [**RedTok**](plugins/redtok/README.md) | RedGifs as a TikTok-style feed – swipe through videos, follow creators and niches, like, and save the ones you want into your library with one tap. Also plays your own Stash scenes as a feed. No account needed. |

Each plugin works on its own – install just the ones you want. They share the same look and work together: with Stash UI installed, Media Storm, the PMV Generator and RedTok show up in its menu, the PMV Generator leads back into Stash UI, and Stash UI's player can hand a video's music straight to the PMV Generator.

## Stash UI at a glance

- **Browse** scenes, images and galleries in justified rows with preview on hover (with sound if you like), infinite scrolling, sorting and filters – tags (include/exclude), performers, rating, favorites, watched, resolution, duration, format.
- **Player**: resume, highlights (heat curve and jump marks), quality, subtitles, speed, VR (180°/360°), fullscreen info panel, queue and similar scenes in the info bar, **mini player** that keeps playing while you browse (drag and resize it anywhere), **Cast to TV** (Chromecast / AirPlay), and **Music** – the sound of a video into the PMV Generator or as a sound file.
- **Performers**: photo cards with search, sort and filters, a page per performer with facts, rating, favorite and all their scenes; edit everything including the photo, and fill it in from StashDB or your performer scrapers. Performers show in the player's info bar, in search and on tag pages.
- **Statistics**: plays, watch time and O counter, weekly activity, a weekday × hour heatmap, top scenes, tags, performers and studios.
- **Duplicates**: scenes that look the same side by side with resolution, bitrate and size – keep the best, delete the rest.
- **Folders, tags, queue, history, search**, tasks with live progress, **plugins** (install, update, sources) and every Stash setting, with a settings search.
- **Your look**: color themes with a color wheel and presets, liquid glass (transparency, blur), background images, animations. Installable as an app (its own window and icon).

## Install

1. In Stash, open **Settings → Plugins → Available Plugins → Add Source**.
2. Name: anything you like. URL: `https://anonym88312.github.io/stash-pmv-plugins/index.yml`
3. The plugins appear in the list below – tick the ones you want and click **Install**.
4. Reload the Stash page.

Updates show up in the same place (**Check for Updates**) – or in Stash UI under **Plugins**, where you can update everything with one click.

Manual install: copy a folder from `plugins/` into your Stash plugins folder and click **Reload plugins** in Settings → Plugins.

### Requirements

- A recent Stash version and a current Chrome, Edge, Safari or Firefox.
- `python` in the PATH for the small backends: saving PMV Generator recordings to Stash, taking the music out of videos, RedTok's downloads, and the optional RedGifs features of Media Storm and the PMV Generator. Everything else runs in the browser.
- ffmpeg – Stash's own is used – for the music out of videos and so saved recordings get a proper duration.

## Development

- No build step for the code itself: plain JavaScript ES modules.
- Stash UI is the source of the shared basics (the CSS, `api.js`, `ui.js`, `theme.js`, `i18n.js`, `pmvsmart.js`, `audiox.js`, the tag picker, the Chinese strings). The PMV Generator owns its own code (`pmvgen.js`, `beats.js`, `pmvfx.js`, `pmvscan.js`, `backend.py`); its `beats.js` is also used by Media Storm. After editing shared files, run `python tools/build.py --sync-only` – it copies them where they're needed and stamps versions against stale browser caches.
- `python tools/build.py` additionally writes the zips and `index.yml` to `dist/`. On every push to `main`, the GitHub Actions workflow builds them and publishes them with GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**).
